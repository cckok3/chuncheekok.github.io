Game theory offers a tool for strategic thinking. It can be thought of as the art of beating your rivals, knowing that they are trying to do the same to you. Individuals, firms, governments and nations behave strategically, for good and bad. Over the last few decades, game theory has been developed for the purpose of understanding social phenomena. It has become the major tool used by social scientists to understand, predict and regulate strategic interaction among agents who have conflicting interests. This unit provides an introduction to game theory with an emphasis on real-world cases, including applications in economics and business.
