This unit examines the notion and implications of market failure in developing countries and discusses possible solutions to addressing such market failure. Specifically, it explores, how in developing countries, innovative and informal institutions fill the void caused by the absence of markets, widespread externalities and the inability of the legal system to enforce contracts. Using a mix of empirical and theoretical approaches this unit examines some of the critical problems faced by developing countries and possible ways of addressing these problems.
