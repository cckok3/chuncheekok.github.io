## About Me
Hi! I'm a Ph.D Candidate at the [Department of Economics](https://www.monash.edu/business/economics) from Monash University, Australia. My research interests lie in the intersection of political economy, economic history, and development economics. My Ph.D thesis evaluates the impact of historical events on short- and long-term economic and political consequences. In my work, I use a mix of historical quasi-experiments, primary surveys, and field experiment. I often undertake extensive novel data collection efforts for which I make use of geocomputation and occasionally LLM.
