I'm a Ph.D Candidate at the [Department of Economics](https://www.monash.edu/business/economics) from Monash University, Australia where my supervisors are Sascha O. Becker and Paul Raschky. I am visiting the [Quantitative Political Economy (QPE) research group](https://sites.google.com/view/kingsqpe/home) at King's College London and the [Department of Economics](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/) at the University of Warwick in 2024. 

I am an applied microeconomist interested in \textbf{economic history, political economy, and development economics}. My thesis investigates how a large-scale colonial resettlement policy shaped voting patterns, interracial relations, and national identity in the mid-20\textsuperscript{th} British Malaya (today's Malaysia). 

My research interests lie in the intersection of political economy, economic history, and development economics. My Ph.D thesis evaluates the impact of historical events on short- and long-term economic and political consequences. In my work, I use a mix of historical quasi-experiments, primary surveys, and field experiment. I often undertake extensive novel data collection efforts for which I make use of geocomputation and occasionally LLM.
