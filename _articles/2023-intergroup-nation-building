excerpt: "Nation building, or the ability to construct a strong, coherent, national identity, is crucial for long-run economic development. Doing so, however, is particularly challenging for ethnically diverse nation-states (Alesina and Zhuvarskaya 2011). In this project, we focus on one aspect -- the extent to which nation building efforts are shaped by (the lack of) macro-level contact across ethnic groups. A crucial problem is that individuals usually have a choice over where they live, and, by extension, whom they interact with. We circumvent this problem by studying a large-scale colonial resettlement program that created 550 mono-ethnic villages; nearly all of which still exist today. Plausibly exogenous placement of these villages offers us persistent inter-village variation in inter-ethnic group contact. Using this variation, we study the long-run effects of inter-group contact on national identity and nation-building efforts. To do so, we have secured funding to conduct an original, large-scale, in-person, retrospective survey. The final survey will measure inter-group contact rates, attitudes and proxies for national identity."
