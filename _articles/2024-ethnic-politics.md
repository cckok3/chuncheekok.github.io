excerpt: "How does inter-group contact shape preferences for ethnic politics? In this paper, we study how persistent differences in inter-ethnic contact affect voting patterns for ethno-nationalistic policies. Specifically, we leverage the effects of a large-scale colonial resettlement program where, in a fight for ``hearts and minds‚Äù, villagers were relocated into 550 fenced-up, isolated, mono-ethnic camps. Using linked administrative data, we show that large-scale resettlement has a clear, causal effect on contemporary ethnic geography and continues to shape contemporary voting patterns."
